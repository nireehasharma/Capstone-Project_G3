PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

To overcome the problem of forgetting to take medicines in elderly people, we came up with a 'SMART MEDICINE REMINDER AND VENDING MACHINE.' 
It is an IoT device which reminds and dispenses medicine on time. 
In this project , we design and develop a medicine reminder and vending machine using Amazon Alexa and Raspberry pi.
The machine saves dispense and alarm time, when it is time to dispense the medicine, the machine alarms the user and dispenses the medicine to the racks.
